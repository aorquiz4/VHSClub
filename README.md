Welcome to the VHS Club, where we will be hosting weird movie nights ~~hopefully~~ periodically. I am your video store clerk, Vincent Van Cool. In this repository is a file named INVENTORY.md that contains a list of the VHS Clubs inventory. Now, if you find that the movie you want to watch isn't there, then feel free to send it my way! (or provide donations and I will acquire them for you) Each title of a movie should be a link that takes you to information about that particular movie. During these viewings I will be providing commentary, sometimes with guests, and answering your questions through a discord chat group. Feel free to browse the inventory and a poll will be held before each viewing on discord. Your vote counts!
